They have specialized toe pads that help them cling to leaves and branches in the trees. These toe pads are lined with tiny adhesive disks. Red-eyed Tree Frogs are nocturnal, meaning they are most active at night. During the day, they rest on leaves with their eyes closed to conserve energy and hide from potential predators.
